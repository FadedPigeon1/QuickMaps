### How It Works

**1. Initialization (popup.js)**

```javascript
- Loads secrets.js with API key
- Creates iframe with default map view (Houston, TX)
- Sets up event listeners for inputs and buttons
- Initializes geolocation handler
```

**2. Directions Process**

```javascript
- User enters origin and destination (or uses geolocation)
- JavaScript captures the inputs
- Maps Embed API URL is constructed with origin/destination
- Iframe src is updated with directions URL
- Map displays full route with turn-by-turn directions
```

**3. Geolocation Process**

```javascript
- User clicks "üìç My Location" button
- Browser requests permission (first time)
- navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition() called
- Coordinates are retrieved (lat, lng)
- Origin field is populated with coordinates
- Destination field is focused for user input
```

**4. UI Rendering (popup.css)**

```css
- Fixed 400x500 viewport
- Flexbox layout for responsive sections
- Purple-blue gradient theme (#667eea to #764ba2)
- Smooth hover animations with transforms
- Box shadows for depth
- Rounded corners (8px border-radius)
```

### API Usage

**Google Maps APIs Used:**

- **Maps Embed API**: Displays maps and directions in iframe
  - `/v1/view` mode: Default map view
  - `/v1/directions` mode: Route between two points

**Browser APIs Used:**

- **Geolocation API**: Gets user's current GPS coordinates
  - `navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition()`
  - Requires user permission

### Code Architecture

**popup.js Functions:**

- `loadDirections(origin, destination)`: Constructs and loads directions URL
- Event listeners: Handle button clicks, Enter key, geolocation
- Geolocation handler: Manages location permission and coordinate retrieval

**CSS Organization:**

- Modern gradients and color schemes
- Component-based styling (header, directions, map)
- Interactive hover and focus states
- Smooth transitions and transforms
- Flexbox layout for responsiveness

## Best Practices

### For Users

- Keep searches simple and specific
- Use well-known place names for better results
- Include city/country for international locations
- Refresh if the extension doesn't load properly

### For Developers

- Replace API key before deployment
- Consider API usage limits (free tier has restrictions)
- Test with various location types
- Keep manifest version updated
- Follow Chrome extension best practices

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. "Google Maps Platform rejected your request" / "Not authorized"**

- **Solution**: Enable Maps Embed API in Google Cloud Console
- Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/maps-embed-backend.googleapis.com
- Click "Enable" and wait 1-2 minutes
- Reload the extension

**2. Map Not Loading / Blank iframe**

- Check `secrets.js` exists and has your real API key
- Verify API key has no extra quotes, spaces, or line breaks
- Ensure billing is enabled on Google Cloud project
- Check browser console for error messages

**3. "üìç My Location" Button Not Working**

- Click the button and allow location permission when prompted
- Check Chrome location settings: chrome://settings/content/location
- If blocked, reset extension permissions
- Ensure you're using HTTPS or localhost (geolocation requirement)

**4. Extension Icon Not Showing**

- Reload the extension in chrome://extensions/ (click ‚ü≥)
- Ensure all icon files exist (icon16.png, icon48.png, icon128.png)
- Check manifest.json has correct icon paths

**5. Directions Not Displaying**

- Enter both origin AND destination (both fields required)
- Try more specific addresses with city/state
- Check that coordinates are valid if using "My Location"
- Ensure Maps Embed API is enabled (not Maps JavaScript API)

### Developer Tools

Open Chrome DevTools while popup is open:

1. Right-click on the extension popup
2. Select "Inspect"
3. Check Console tab for errors
4. Check iframe src URL in Elements tab
5. Use Network tab to verify API calls

### Location Permission Issues

If geolocation is blocked:

1. Go to chrome://extensions/
2. Find QuickMaps ‚Üí Click "Details"
3. Scroll to "Permissions" ‚Üí Check "Location"
4. Or: Click the lock icon in the popup ‚Üí Set Location to "Allow"

## Privacy & Permissions

### Permissions Used

- **Geolocation**: Required for "üìç My Location" feature
  - Only accessed when you click the location button
  - Browser prompts for permission (one-time approval)
  - You can deny permission and still use manual addresses
- All Google Maps API calls are standard HTTPS requests
- No user data is stored or collected

### Data Usage

- Directions queries are sent to Google Maps Embed API

- Extension works entirely in the browser

### Security
