### How It Works

**1. Initialization (popup.js)**
```javascript
- Loads Google Maps API
- Creates map instance with default location
- Initializes geocoder for address conversion
- Places initial marker
```

**2. Search Process**
```javascript
- User enters search query
- JavaScript captures the input
- Geocoder API converts query to coordinates
- Map centers on new location
- Marker updates to new position
- Viewport adjusts for optimal view
```

**3. UI Rendering (popup.css)**
```css
- Fixed 400x500 viewport
- Flexbox layout for responsive sections
- Blue (#4285f4) theme matching Google brand
- Smooth transitions on interactive elements
```

### API Usage

**Google Maps APIs Used:**
- **Maps JavaScript API**: Renders the interactive map
- **Geocoding API**: Converts addresses to coordinates
- **Places API**: Library loaded for potential future enhancements

### Code Architecture

**popup.js Functions:**
- `initMap()`: Initializes the map on page load
- `searchPlace(query)`: Handles location search and map updates
- Event listeners: Handle user interactions (clicks, keypresses)

**CSS Organization:**
- Reset styles for consistency
- Component-based styling (header, search, map)
- Responsive hover and active states
- Flexible layout with CSS Grid and Flexbox
